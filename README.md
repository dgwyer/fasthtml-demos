# Example FastHTML Apps

This is (or will be) a collection of demo FastHTML apps I'm creating to help me learn HTMX, FastHTML, SQLite and other related technologies.

Feel free to suggest an app! Just open a new issue.

# [Tailwind in FastHTML](/01-tailwind-basic/)

Basic example of integrating TailwindCSS in a FastHTML app. This features live reload too, which is a really nice developer experience when used with TailwindCSS. Every time you update a Tailwind class the app live reloads almost instantly!
